- [ ] I am not reporting a bug. If I am, I will use the bug report issue template
- [ ] I understand that I am not maintaining this codebase, and my suggestion may be rejected for reasons as simple as "We don't really feel like it" or "That's a little out of scope for this project" (We accept most suggestions, though.)
- [ ] I also understand that even if we do accept your suggestion, it may be removed from the extension at any time, for any reason, without notification. It may even not make it to a release version of the extension.
